To use fixed point data within the vivado environment I have to compile the package from the vivado source. I found all the information at the
documentation provided b xilinx in the documentation explorer. The documentation title is part of the Design Suite Guide. The pdf documents are
Design Suite Guide Synthesis and Design Suite Guide Logic Simulation. Note: It is fundamental to compile the vhdl files under VHDL2008. 

I understood that vivado doesn't support the bread function.
